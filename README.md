# Citation-Prediction

Link prediction is the problem of predicting the existence of a link between two entities in a network.

The problem of link prediction has recently attracted a lot of attention in many domains. For instance, in social networks, one may be interested in predicting friendship links among users, while in biology, predicting interactions between genes and proteins is of paramount importance.

In a kaggle challenge through data mining university course, we dealed with the problem of predicting whether a research paper cites another research paper. We were given a citation network consisting of several thousands of research papers, along with their abstracts and their list of authors. The pipeline that is typically followed to deal with the problem is similar to the one applied in any classification problem; the goal was to predict whether two nodes are linked by an edge or not.
